This repository is the source code for a submission place made using Rōblox Studio + Rojo for evaluation by Suit Up Games. 69th (nice) repository on my profile.

The premise of my game is that you (the player(s)) are being chased by a horde of various VisualPlugin plugins.

Some move fast; others slowly.

Some will physically spring their way towards you. Others enjoy tweening in a state of Knitted quantum-esque bliss.

All of them do carry a shiny coat of reflective armour for maximum sterling style; watch out.

Whatever the path, they're definitely out for the closest ones among you.

Why so evil? Well ... it's in their object-oriented programming.

Hit the flying plugins with your enlarged sword, courtesy Rōblox, to reveal their true (brick) colours.

Those plugins like to respawn from the air and will always find a way to do so ... cleanly. That way, the fun never ends!

Got a kill? Share those extra points with everyone in a seven-stud radius (the game does that for you automatically).
